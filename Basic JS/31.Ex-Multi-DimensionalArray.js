// Shopping List

/*
Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.

["Chocolate Bar", 15]

There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.
*/

var myList = [
  ["item 1", 5],
  ["item 2", 5],
  ["item 3", 5],
  ["item 4", 5],
  ["item 5", 5]
];

// Best practice to write them like this !
